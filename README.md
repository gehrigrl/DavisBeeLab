# DavisBeeLab
These files contain code I wrote to clean and analyze data while working in the E.L. Nino Honey Bee Lab at UC Davis. 

BeeAlignmentCode.py temporally aligns a bee activity data set with a weather data set.

The 2017Analysis files implement various statistical methods to investigate colony health, mortality, and mite infestation levels.
